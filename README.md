[![Clippy Linting Result](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/lemonrock/rust_extra/master/badge.svg?style=plastic)](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/lemonrock/rust_extra/master/log) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Style-rustfmt-brightgreen.svg?style=plastic)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt#configuring-rustfmt)

[rust_extra] is a rust crate that provides additional features that are useful extensions to the language or standard libraries. Currently, this list includes:-

* A wrapper around the 'likely' intrinsic, so it can be used without `unsafe`
* A wrapper around the 'unlikely' intrinsic, so it can be used without `unsafe`
* A macro providing something very similar to a do-while loop
